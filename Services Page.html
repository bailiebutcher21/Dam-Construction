              <div class="box1"><h2>Site Preparation</h2><p>At C&C Site Development we know that the site preparation process is the first task that must be completed.  Engineers need a clear and properly prepared site to.  To start a new project in a site that is unfriendly to the project can destroy plans, hinder building permits and damage the overall project. It is a challenging activity that must be dealt with before any building project can begin in earnest.</p></div>

              <div class="box4"><h2>Residential Development </h2><p>A residential area is a land use in which housing predominates, as opposed to industrial and commercial areas. Housing may vary significantly between, and through, residential areas. These include single-family housing, multi-family residential, or mobile homes. Zoning for residential use may permit some services or work opportunities or may totally exclude business and industry. It may permit high density land use or only permit low density uses. Residential zoning usually includes a smaller FAR (floor area ratio) than business, commercial or industrial/manufacturing zoning. The area may be large or small.</p></div>

                <div class="box5"><h2>Other Heavy Civil Activities</h2><p>Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure.[1] Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser, while construction typically takes place on location for a known client.[2] Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries.[3] Construction starts with planning, design, and financing; and continues until the project is built and ready for use.</p></div>
